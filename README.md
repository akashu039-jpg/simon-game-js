# 🎮 Simon Game

The **Simon Game** is a fun and interactive memory-based game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It challenges players to remember and repeat an increasingly long sequence of colors.

## 🧠 About the Game

Simon is a classic memory game where the system generates a random sequence of colors.  
The player must repeat the same sequence in the correct order.  
Each successful round increases the difficulty by adding one more color to the sequence.

This project was created as part of my learning journey in **frontend web development** and **JavaScript logic building**.
